Git rules:
1. Implement and test new features on separate branch. Don't push to master!
2. When you're ready to merge to master, push to your remote feature branch. Then create a pull request, and ask to get a code review. 
3. All code must be reviewed by at least one other group member. Once reviewed and needed changes have been made, merge the pull request!
